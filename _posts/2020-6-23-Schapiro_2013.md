title: Creating Sequence Boundaries by Temporal Community Structures
---

The paper to be reviewed today is [“Neural representations of events arise from temporal community structure”](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3331) by Schapiro and colleagues, published in 2013 on Nature Neuroscience. It was well-known that people create sequence boundaries when the uncertainty was high. In the current paper, the authors argued the sequence boundaries could also be created when the mental representations of stimuli form various clusters, even when uncertainty remained constant. The current experiment confirmed the argument through behavioural tasks, fMRI analyses, and computational modelling. 

Introduction 
------
People experience the world by a continuous flow of information. However, the continuous experience often gets spontaneously segmented into various discrete events with clear and well-agreed boundaries. A question that follows is under what conditions will people create the event boundaries. There has been converging evidence suggesting that event boundaries are created where uncertainty was high. The current paper argued that community structure, which stands for clustered mental representations, could also be used to create boundaries. 

Methods
------
The experimenters created community structures by altering the order of stimuli presentation. 15 stimuli without inherent structures were randomly placed into the nodes of a community structure shown below. In the structure, each node is connected with four other nodes, and thus controlling for the uncertainty. The stimuli were presented by a “walk” through the structure. In experiment 1, the walk was random; in experiment two, they manually set the order such that it was equally likely to stay within the community and move to the next community when at boundaries nodes (shown with the lightly colored nodes). The experiment started with 35 minutes of viewing phase, and 15 minutes of review phase, in which participants indicated sequence boundaries in experiment 1 and 2, and did a cover task in experiment 3 (a fMRI experiment).

Results
------
Participants were more likely to place boundaries between community structures, regardless of the walk strategy, showing that community structure could support sequence segmentation while predictability is controlled. fMRI univariate analyses showed that mPFC was deactivated at the community boundaries, wheres IFG and insula were more activated as more items from the same community were viewed. MVPA indicated that the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior temporal lobe, and superior temporal gyrus showed more similar activation pattern for items from the same community. The researchers than trained a fully connected three-layer neural network to predict the next item given the current item. The hidden layer, which the authors argued to represent mental representations, also showed sequence boundaries and similar within-community representations. In a follow-up study in 2016, Schapiro and colleagues also found the hippocampus to demonstrate both deactivation at sequence boundaries, and similar within-community representations. 

Discussion 
------
The researchers further suggested that sequence boundary formation might be a part of a more general process than once thought. The same brain regions (mPFC, IFG, and HPC) have also been involved in other forms of boundary formation, such as categorization and artificial grammar.

My opinion
------
I’ve always loved to read the type of papers that point to a complementary novel aspect of a well-known effect, and this paper does exactly that. I especially like how they gathered converging evidence from human behaviour, neuroimaging, and computational modelling, showcasing how sequence segmentation by community structure is both biologically plausible and computationally effective. The only issue is that despite the similar findings, there seems to be a lack of justification on why we could think of the hidden layer of a neural network to represent human’s mental representations. The activation level of the neural network is a product of the chain rule in calculus, whereas mental representation is the result of very complicated interactions between neuronal firings and the current cognitive state. Of course, there could certainly be more sophisticated arguments that I don’t know of yet.
