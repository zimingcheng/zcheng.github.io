I have just graduated from the undergraduate psychology research program at the Univeristy of Toronto, now doing full-time RA at Moscovitch lab, Barense lab, and Mack lab. My main academic interest is to study how episodic memory, place, and time interact to allow us remember what we remember. I'm also interested in studying other cognitive processes that the hippocampus is involved in, such as imagination and concept learning, and why they take up the same brain region as episodic memory. I use behavioural experiments, fMRI imagining, and computational modeling to study those questions. 

Now that the labs are closed amid COVID, it gives me more time to get familiar with the literature. This blog documents some of the interesting papers and talks that I encountered during this period. I hope the summaries here would be helpful and/or interesting to you as well!
